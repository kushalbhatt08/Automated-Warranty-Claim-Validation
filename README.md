# 🛠️ Automated Warranty Claim Validation  
A Machine Learning Approach to Fraud Detection in Warranty Claims

## 📌 Overview  
**Automated Warranty Claim Validation** is a data-driven system designed to identify fraudulent warranty claims using machine learning techniques. Warranty fraud leads to significant financial losses for companies, and manual verification can be slow, inconsistent, and resource-intensive.  
This project automates the validation process by analyzing historical claim patterns, extracting meaningful features, and applying predictive models to distinguish between **genuine** and **fraudulent** warranty submissions.
