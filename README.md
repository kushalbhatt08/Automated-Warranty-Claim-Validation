# Automated-Warranty-Claim-Validation

#Automated Warranty Claim Validation is a machine learningâ€“based system designed to detect fraudulent warranty claims and ensure authenticity in after-sales service processes. This project leverages data analytics, classification algorithms, and predictive modeling to identify patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior in warranty submissions.

#The system takes in historical warranty claim data, extracts key features such as product type, claim date, repair costs, and customer history, and trains models to differentiate between genuine and fraudulent claims. By automating the validation process, the solution reduces manual verification time, minimizes financial losses, and enhances operational efficiency.
